# Video-Game-Sales-on-a-Global-Scale
Business analysis of global video game sales with a focus on Nintendoâ€™s performance, market trends, and competitor insights.
This project analyzes a dataset of 16,598 video game sales records across platforms, publishers, and regions.  
The goal is to explore **Nintendo's performance** in the global gaming market, compare it with competitors, and highlight business insights.

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle (Video Game Sales)  
- 16,598 records, cleaned to remove incomplete entries.  
- Features: Name, Platform, Year, Genre, Publisher, Regional Sales, Global Sales.  

## Key Business Questions
1. How does Nintendo compare to Sony and Microsoft in global sales?  
2. Which genres and platforms drive Nintendoâ€™s success?  
3. Which regions contribute most to Nintendoâ€™s sales?  
4. What trends emerge over time for Nintendo consoles?

## Modeling
## ðŸ¤– Predictive Modeling â€” Hit Game Classification

To predict whether a game would sell more than **1M copies globally**, I compared two models: **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**.

### Model Performance

| Metric | Logistic Regression | Random Forest |
|-------|------------------|-------------|
| Accuracy | 0.61 | **0.70** |
| Precision (Hit) | 0.19 | **0.22** |
| Recall (Hit) | **0.67** | 0.54 |
| F1-Score (Hit) | 0.30 | **0.31** |
| ROC-AUC | **0.70** | 0.68 |

### Key Insights
- Logistic Regression achieved **higher recall** (caught more hits), but at the cost of very low precision and overall accuracy.
- Random Forest provided a **better balance** of precision, recall, and accuracy, making it the preferred model.
- **Feature importance** analysis showed that Platform, Genre, and Year strongly influence a gameâ€™s likelihood of being a hit, with platforms like Wii and DS dominating.

### Final Model Selection
**Random Forest** was chosen as the final model because it generalizes better and offers interpretable attribute importances that support business decisions.

### Business Takeaways
- **Platform choice is critical**: Nintendoâ€™s most successful periods align with strong console cycles (Wii, DS).
- **Genre strategy matters**: Platform and Role-Playing titles drive the bulk of hit games.
- This model can be used as a **screening tool** to flag potential hits for further marketing or production investment.
